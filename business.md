 This is a business model canvas made by the High Stakes team, considering these 3 markets. We also conducted some market research, in which we were able to interview Toa Alta farmer Carlos Cruz, which gave us some insight into the needs of the agricultural industry.

 Q: Have you noticed any trends or curiosities about the environment on your property?\
A: I have noticed periods of 7 weeks of sun, plus 90 degrees. Before that it was 6 weeks of rain. Now we are in drought. I used a cistern and I ran out of water for a week. The tanks could not be refilled due to the lack of rain. The planting of chick peas is one that's changed. 15 to 20 years ago it was harvested from September to October for Christmas, but now we have to wait around Easter.

Q: What methods do you use to monitor the weather on your property?\
A: I use a rain gauge to read the amount of precipitation. The amount of rain is recorded every day.

Q: Do you feel safe with the information you receive about your property?\
A: It falls in my area, I received the rain gauge from the meteorological service. But there is no reliability of data to report that there is drought in certain areas (other towns), we have a lack of data registration.

Q: How does the weather affect your production?\
A: I lose the harvest.

Q: Do you think you would benefit from a monitoring system that lets you know the weather conditions around your property?\
A: Best of the whole island, to know how the weather is going on other farms.

Q: Do you have another need that is not met?\
A: In the northwest and south area of ​​the island there is a system of irrigation channels, from the cane season. This covers a couple of towns, but in Toa Baja we depend on the AAA or a well. I have no well and avoid using AAA. AAA is too expensive but unfortunately there are no companies that make cheap wells. After Maria the well costs increased by about 50%. I asked for 3 different estimates and they were at more or less $ 18,000, the most expensive said $ 26,000. The permit process also increases the cost (Natural Resource's permit, landowner's permit, etc.). All this interferes with operations because you need too many permits and they cost too much time and money. The government doesn't give much help either.
